        Paragraph writing involves developing a single main idea through a
        series of connected sentences, typically consisting of a topic sentence,
        supporting sentences, and a concluding sentence. The topic sentence
        introduces the central idea, the supporting sentences provide details,
        evidence, or explanations, and the concluding sentence summarizes or
        wraps up the idea. Good paragraph writing requires focusing on one
        topic, ensuring coherence and flow between sentences, and using clear
        language to guide the reader.
